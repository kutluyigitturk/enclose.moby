## 🎮 How to Play

**Objective:** Trap Moby Dick in the smallest possible area using buoys.

| Action | Control |
|--------|---------|
| Place buoy | `Left Click` on sea tile |
| Remove buoy | `Left Click` on placed buoy |
| Reset level | Click `Reset Level` button |

### 📋 Rules

- 🌊 Click on sea tiles to place buoys (walls)
- 🚫 You have limited buoys per level
- 🐋 Moby Dick cannot swim diagonally or over walls
- 📐 Smaller enclosure = Higher score
- ✨ The game auto-detects when Moby is trapped

---

## ⚡ Features

### 🧠 Smart Game Mechanics
- **Auto-Detection System** — BFS algorithm instantly calculates if Moby Dick is trapped after each buoy placement
- **Area-Based Scoring** — Score is determined by how small the enclosed area is, not by buoys used
- **Non-Blocking Gameplay** — No annoying pop-ups; continue playing even after winning

### 🎨 Visual Design
- **Dynamic Wave System** — Intense waves outside the play area, calm waters inside
- **Detailed Islands** — 4 different land tile variations with borders and textures
- **Layered Rendering** — Win effects render below Moby Dick, grid lines above all elements
- **Animated Buoys** — Smooth 3-frame animation when placing buoys
- **Ghost Preview** — Semi-transparent preview shows where buoys will be placed

### 🖥️ User Interface
- **Integrated Scoreboard** — Score displayed as `Area: X` in the bottom-right corner
- **Custom Favicon** — Moby Dick icon in browser tab
- **Single File Architecture** — All assets embedded as Base64, no external dependencies
